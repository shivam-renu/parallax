            The shore is my favorite place because it is a place where I can go on vacation every summer. It is a place where you just go there and relax. I can get away from my everyday life and do different things then what I do back at home.
             At the shore there are colorful seashells in the sand when the sun hits down on them. In the distance is the ocean, which is as blue as blue as the sky. Another things that I can see are the seagulls free like the wind soar through the sky. Down at the shore you see a lot of people around the shore like a herd of wild animals.

            Downtown is a term primarily used in North America by English speakers to refer to a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political and geographic heart. It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD). Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city's employment. In some metropolitan areas it is marked by a cluster of tall buildings, cultural institutions and the convergence of rail transit and bus lines. In British English, the term "city centre" is most often used instead.

        <p>
            Stonehenge is perhaps the world’s most famous prehistoric monument. It was built in several stages: the first monument was an early henge monument, built about 5,000 years ago, and the unique stone circle was erected in the late Neolithic period about 2500 BC. In the early Bronze Age many burial mounds were built nearby.The earliest structures known in the immediate area are four or five pits, three of which appear to have held large pine ‘totem-pole like’ posts erected in the Mesolithic period, between 8500 and 7000 BC.[1] It is not known how these posts relate to the later monument of Stonehenge.

            Nature  is the cause of our  existence. Trees are an essential and vital part of nature. Beauty means sweetness, loveliness. It means inward truth. Trees are crowned with that jewel. A tree has several parts. Such as roots, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits. Each & every part of tree has a beauty. These scattered beauty makes the whole beauty with the all elements. Nature is bliss to us. The trees are an asset to human beings. There are six seasons in earth.Trees make these seasons complete  with their presence. In summer  there are  so many trees like champa, sunflower which bloomed make the world beautiful. Besides that there are fruits like mango and watermelon which are the symbol of juicy beauty of summer. In monsoon the trees become green & lively. The earth is covered with green velvet in this  season.This beauty is the symbol of innocence, purity & holiness. These all are qualities of internal beauty. Bu it is mother nature’s grace so we can visualize with our eyes & feel with our heart. In early autumn the trees present themselves with calmness and gentle breeze.
