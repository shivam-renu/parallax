            The shore is my favorite place because it is a place where I can go on vacation every summer. It is a place where you just go there and relax. I can get away from my everyday life and do different things then what I do back at home.
             At the shore there are colorful seashells in the sand when the sun hits down on them. In the distance is the ocean, which is as blue as blue as the sky. Another things that I can see are the seagulls free like the wind soar through the sky. Down at the shore you see a lot of people around the shore like a herd of wild animals.
             Most people can hear the loud funny screams of the people as they walk by them. At the shore you can hear the crash of the waves against the sand. When walking on the boardwalk you can hear the loud noisy music at all the different games and rides.
             The smell at the shore can be good. The smell of the fresh cooked food at all the different restaurants on the boardwalk and the city is the favorite. It makes me want to eat all the time. As you walk down the beach the strong smell of the coconut sun block comes toward my nose. The smell was so strong that you can smell it a mile away. In the morning you can smell the fresh morning air as you wake as you walk towards the shimmering shore.
             When you walk on the beach you can feel the hot rough sand on your feet. As you walk on the sand you can feel different, sharp seashells stabbing at your feet. When you go into the ocean, it feels nice and cool because the day is so hot that it cools me down.
             The best part about the shore is the food. You can taste all the different kinds of food, like pizza, burgers, and the best part of it are the seafood. Another of the best things to eat is ice cream. The clod creamy chocolate ice cream cools my throat. A bad taste about the shore is the taste of the salty water when you in the ocean.
             At nighttime I always go on the boardwalk and go for a nice stroll around. I find things to...

            Downtown is a term primarily used in North America by English speakers to refer to a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political and geographic heart. It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD). Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city's employment. In some metropolitan areas it is marked by a cluster of tall buildings, cultural institutions and the convergence of rail transit and bus lines. In British English, the term "city centre" is most often used instead.

        <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="para-3">
        <p>
            Stonehenge is perhaps the world’s most famous prehistoric monument. It was built in several stages: the first monument was an early henge monument, built about 5,000 years ago, and the unique stone circle was erected in the late Neolithic period about 2500 BC. In the early Bronze Age many burial mounds were built nearby.The earliest structures known in the immediate area are four or five pits, three of which appear to have held large pine ‘totem-pole like’ posts erected in the Mesolithic period, between 8500 and 7000 BC.[1] It is not known how these posts relate to the later monument of Stonehenge.

            At this time, when much of the rest of southern England was largely covered by woodland, the chalk downland in the area of Stonehenge may have been an unusually open landscape.[2] It is possible that this is why it became the site of an early Neolithic monument complex.
            
            This complex included the causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood’s Ball, two cursus monuments or rectangular earthworks (the Greater, or Stonehenge, and Lesser Cursus), and several long barrows, all dating from the centuries around 3500 BC. The presence of these monuments probably influenced the later location of Stonehenge.

Today, together with Avebury, Stonehenge forms the heart of a World Heritage Site, with a unique concentration of prehistoric monuments.

            Nature  is the cause of our  existence. Trees are an essential and vital part of nature. Beauty means sweetness, loveliness. It means inward truth. Trees are crowned with that jewel. A tree has several parts. Such as roots, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits. Each & every part of tree has a beauty. These scattered beauty makes the whole beauty with the all elements. Nature is bliss to us. The trees are an asset to human beings. There are six seasons in earth.Trees make these seasons complete  with their presence. In summer  there are  so many trees like champa, sunflower which bloomed make the world beautiful. Besides that there are fruits like mango and watermelon which are the symbol of juicy beauty of summer. In monsoon the trees become green & lively. The earth is covered with green velvet in this  season.This beauty is the symbol of innocence, purity & holiness. These all are qualities of internal beauty. Bu it is mother nature’s grace so we can visualize with our eyes & feel with our heart. In early autumn the trees present themselves with calmness and gentle breeze. The blooming lotus in the pond is a good example of trees’ divine beauty. In late autumn  grass with dew drops, tress with light snow and mild breeze  complete the sense of the season.
